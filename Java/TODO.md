###Gilded Rose To Do List

#### Done
- Test GildedRose logic separately from the individual items logic
- Improve encapsulation of items[0] in the gilded rose logic
- Remove duplication on the creation of GildedRose in tests 
  - Done due to splitting the tests more thinly. Duplication is less prevalent but might reoccur as more features add up)
- SimpleItem logic should not be tested inside conjured item logic

#### TODO

- Slight unknowns around Sulfuras
- Improve assertions using matchers
- Improve data creation
