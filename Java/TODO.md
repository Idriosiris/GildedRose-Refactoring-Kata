###Gilded Rose To Do List

#### Done
- Test GildedRose logic separately from the individual items logic
- Improve encapsulation of items[0] in the gilded rose logic
- Remove duplication on the creation of GildedRose in tests (done due 
  to splitting the tests more tingly. Duplication is less prevalent but might 
  reoccur as more features add up)

#### TODO

- SimpleItem logic should not be tested inside conjured item logic
- Slight unknowns around Sulfuras
- Improve assertions using matchers
- Improve data creation
